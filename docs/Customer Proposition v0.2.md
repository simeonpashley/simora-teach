### **The Problem**

Teachers spend countless hours on administrative tasks like lesson planning, progress tracking, and communication. These challenges are compounded in underfunded schools, where limited resources force educators to manage overwhelming workloads.

- **For EYFS Teachers**: Tracking developmental milestones is fragmented and time-consuming.
- **For SEN Teachers**: Managing IEPs and personalised learning goals without streamlined tools is overwhelming.
- **For Administrators**: Monitoring performance and compliance is difficult without integrated, cost-effective systems.

**The Result**: Teachers are overburdened, with less time to focus on the core of their vocation—teaching.
