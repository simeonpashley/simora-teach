# Customer Proposition: Rose by Simora

## Context and Background

**Rose by Simora** is a purpose-built education management platform developed in response to challenges identified by Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and Special Educational Needs (SEN) teachers. Through extensive consultation with educators, we identified a critical UK-wide pain point: the overwhelming administrative workload faced by teachers, particularly in underfunded or poorly run schools. These challenges hinder teachers from focusing on their passion: delivering high-quality education and nurturing student growth.

This proposition captures the value that **Rose by Simora** offers, providing a reusable reference point for stakeholder alignment and decision-making.

3. **Underfunded Schools**: Teachers often lack access to affordable, efficient tools, leaving them to work with inadequate resources.
