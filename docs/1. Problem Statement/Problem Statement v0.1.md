# Problem Statement Document: Rose by Simora

## Context
The development of **Rose by Simora** stems from a critical pain point identified through extensive consultations with EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) and SEN (Special Educational Needs) teachers across the UK. These educators face overwhelming administrative workloads that detract from their primary goal: providing high-quality, individualised education to students. This document outlines the core problems addressed by Rose by Simora and the implications for educators, students, and schools.

## Problem Statement
### **1. Administrative Burden**
**Challenge**: Teachers spend significant time on administrative tasks, such as tracking developmental milestones, managing Individual Education Plans (IEPs), creating lesson plans, and compiling progress reports. These tasks often require juggling fragmented tools, manual processes, or outdated systems.

**Impact**:
- Reduces the time available for direct interaction with students.
- Contributes to teacher burnout and job dissatisfaction.
- Leads to delays and inaccuracies in progress tracking and reporting.

---

### **2. Fragmented Tools and Processes**
**Challenge**: The tools available for educators are often not tailored to the specific needs of EYFS and SEN teaching. For example, existing solutions lack:
- Pre-built frameworks for tracking EYFS developmental milestones.
- Customisable progress trackers for SEN goals and IEPs.
- Unified systems to consolidate lesson planning, reporting, and communication.

**Impact**:
- Forces educators to rely on disconnected systems, increasing inefficiency.
- Limits the ability to monitor student progress holistically.
- Complicates collaboration between teachers, parents, and administrators.

---

### **3. Communication Challenges**
**Challenge**: Maintaining clear, consistent communication with parents and guardians is difficult without centralised tools for logging interactions, sharing progress, and tracking follow-ups.

**Impact**:
- Results in miscommunication or missed opportunities for parental engagement.
- Adds additional manual work to teachers’ already full schedules.
- Reduces transparency and trust between educators and families.

---

### **4. Limited Resources in Underfunded Schools**
**Challenge**: Schools in underfunded areas struggle to afford expensive education management platforms, leaving teachers without access to modern tools.

**Impact**:
- Creates inequity between well-funded and underfunded schools.
- Forces teachers to spend personal time and money finding alternative solutions.
- Prevents schools from maintaining compliance with educational standards effectively.

---

### **5. Compliance and Security Concerns**
**Challenge**: Teachers and administrators need tools that comply with UK educational standards, GDPR, and data protection regulations. Many existing solutions fail to provide the necessary assurances.

**Impact**:
- Increases the risk of non-compliance, leading to potential fines and reputational damage.
- Reduces trust in the tools and processes used by schools.

---

## Implications of the Problem
If left unaddressed, these challenges will continue to:
1. Undermine the ability of teachers to deliver high-quality education.
2. Reduce overall teacher satisfaction and retention.
3. Limit student outcomes, particularly in EYFS and SEN contexts.
4. Exacerbate inequalities between well-funded and underfunded schools.

---

## Supporting Evidence
- **Educator Consultations**: Surveys and interviews with EYFS and SEN teachers highlighted administrative overload as a primary concern.
- **Industry Reports**: Research indicates that teachers spend an average of 30% of their time on administrative tasks.
- **Case Studies**: Examples of underfunded schools struggling to implement cohesive education management systems demonstrate the need for affordable, efficient solutions.

---

## Conclusion
The problems faced by EYFS and SEN teachers demand a solution that is tailored, efficient, and affordable. **Rose by Simora** aims to address these challenges by providing a centralised, user-friendly platform that empowers educators to focus on their passion: teaching and nurturing students’ growth. This approach will not only alleviate current pain points but also improve teacher satisfaction, student outcomes, and school performance across the UK.
