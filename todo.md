# PII Encryption Implementation Plan

### **Stage 1: Basic Setup**

#### Tasks

[ ] **Encrypt PII on Insert**:
   [ ] Modify the API layer to encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., name, email) using `crypto` in TypeScript.
   [ ] Update Drizzle ORM migrations to add encrypted columns.

     EXAMPLE:

     typescript
     import { pgTable, serial, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

     export const users = pgTable('users', {
       id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
       encrypted_name: text('encrypted_name'),
     });

[ ] **Modify Insertion Logic**:
   [ ] Update API to encrypt data before inserting it into Postgres.

     EXAMPLE:

     typescript
     const encryptedName = encrypt('John Doe'); // Custom function for AES-256 encryption
     await db.insert(users).values({ encrypted_name: encryptedName });

[ ] **Decrypt PII on Fetch**:
   [ ] Fetch encrypted PII from the database and decrypt it on the server.

     EXAMPLE:

     typescript
     const user = await db.select(users.encrypted_name).where(users.id.eq(1)).execute();
     const decryptedName = decrypt(user[0]?.encrypted_name || '');

[ ] **Create a Test Endpoint**:
   [ ] Create an API route (`/api/test-encryption`) to test data insertion and retrieval.

#### Testing Tasks

[ ] Write unit tests:
   [ ] Verify encryption logic by encrypting and decrypting sample data.
   [ ] Validate database writes include encrypted fields.
   [ ] Validate API returns decrypted data.
[ ] Perform integration tests:
   [ ] Simulate insert and fetch operations via `/api/test-encryption`.

---

### **Stage 2: Enhancements**

#### Tasks

[ ] **Support Client-Side Encryption**:
   [ ] Implement client-side encryption using the WebCrypto API.

     typescript
     async function encryptClientData(data: string, key: CryptoKey): Promise<string> {
       const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
       const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
         { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
         key,
         new TextEncoder().encode(data)
       );
       return JSON.stringify({ iv: Array.from(iv), ciphertext: Array.from(new Uint8Array(encrypted)) });
     }

   [ ] Update the API to handle pre-encrypted data from the client.

[ ] **Update API to Handle Decryption**:
   [ ] Add logic to store encrypted blobs in Postgres without further server-side encryption.

[ ] **Add Key Management**:
   [ ] Use a passphrase or token to derive keys securely on the client.

#### Testing Tasks

[ ] Write unit tests:
   [ ] Validate client-side encryption using mock data.
   [ ] Verify compatibility between client-side encrypted data and server decryption.
[ ] Perform end-to-end tests:
   [ ] Insert encrypted data via the client and verify correctness via the API.
   [ ] Run `pnpm test` to ensure no regressions.

---

### **Stage 3: Actions and Interactivity**

#### Tasks

[ ] **Implement CRUD Operations with Encryption**:
   [ ] **Create**: Encrypt data on the client and insert it via the API.
   [ ] **Read**: Fetch encrypted data and decrypt it on the client.
   [ ] **Update**: Support client-side encryption for updates, re-encrypting modified fields.
   [ ] **Delete**: Remove encrypted data securely from the database.

[ ] **Update Forms**:
   [ ] Ensure all forms encrypt PII before submission using WebCrypto.

[ ] **Add Error Handling**:
   [ ] Display meaningful error messages for encryption/decryption failures.

#### Testing Tasks

[ ] Write unit tests:
   [ ] Test CRUD operations with encrypted data.
   [ ] Validate error handling for invalid keys or corrupted data.
[ ] Perform integration tests:
   [ ] Simulate user interactions (e.g., create, update, delete) and verify encrypted database writes.
   [ ] Run `pnpm test` to ensure all tests pass.

---

### **Stage 4: Optimisation**

#### Tasks

[ ] **Improve Performance**:
   [ ] Use indexed columns for encrypted fields (e.g., hash columns for searching).

     typescript
     export const users = pgTable('users', {
       encrypted_name: text('encrypted_name'),
       name_hash: text('name_hash').index(),
     });

   [ ] Store a SHA-256 hash of PII for lookup purposes.

[ ] **Add Pagination**:
   [ ] Implement server-side pagination for fetching encrypted data efficiently.

[ ] **Harden Security**:
   [ ] Use environment variables for keys and secrets.
   [ ] Audit the application for plaintext PII exposure.

[ ] **Accessibility and Usability**:
   [ ] Ensure error messages and loading states meet accessibility standards.

#### Testing Tasks

[ ] Write unit tests:
   [ ] Verify search and pagination work with encrypted fields.
   [ ] Test hash-based lookups for encrypted data.
[ ] Perform system-wide tests:
   [ ] Run `pnpm test` to ensure all performance and security optimizations are functional.

---

### **Stage 5: Deployment and Monitoring**

#### Tasks

[ ] Deploy the application to the staging environment.
[ ] Enable logging for encryption/decryption failures using tools like DataDog or Sentry.
[ ] Monitor system performance and error rates post-deployment.

#### Testing Tasks

[ ] Perform smoke tests in staging:
   [ ] Test end-to-end functionality (CRUD, client encryption, server decryption).
[ ] Validate logging and error alerts for encryption-related issues.
